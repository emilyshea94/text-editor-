# text-editor-

## Description
For this challenge I was given the starter code to complete for a text edior that runs in the browser. After adding code into "TO DO" categories I installed a webpack package and other packages needed to make this server run properly. I had to change some of the already existing code to make my server run. I worked with a tutor to help me with the many issues I had trying to get my server to run, one being a connection error 
between the ``index.html`` and the ``dist``file. I fixed this by moving the ``index.html`` into the ``dist`` file. 

## Usage
When the user runs this application in their termianl and create content in a text-editor that they can hen download and use as an icon on their desktop. 


## Installation
``npm install`` to install dependencies.
  ``npm run start`` to start the backend
